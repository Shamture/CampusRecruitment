Most of the companies like to have budding professionals from the zero day slot and for this need, we have built up a strong corporate relation and tie up with top notch companies so that they can visit our campus for recruitment process and hire students as per their need.
As this is the era of globalization, the need of the hour is training individuals to excel in the face of challenges thrown up by a 
rapidly changing socio-economic-technological scenario at the global level. The younger generation must strive to develop into a well 
rounded personality with excellent technical, managerial, interpersonal and communication skills; poised at the cutting-edge of technology. 
In this context, the Training & Placement Cell is doing a commendable job.
